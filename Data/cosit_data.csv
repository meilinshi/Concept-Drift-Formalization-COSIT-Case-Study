1992,Do people understand spatial concepts: The case of first-order primitives,"The purpose of this paper is to examine whether people in general understand elementary spatial concepts, and to examine whether or not naive spatial knowledge includes the ability to understand important spatial primitives that are built into geographic theory, spatial databases and geographic information systems (GIS). The extent of such understanding is a partial measure of spatial ability. Accurate indicators or measures of spatial ability can be used to explain different types of spatial behavior. In this paper I first examine the relation between spatial ability and spatial behavior, then present experimental evidence of the ability of people to understand spatial concepts such as nearest neighbors (proximity), and spatial distributions. A final commentary is made about the possible difference between “common sense” and “expert” spatial knowledge, and the implications of such results for the comprehension of space at all scales.","Geographic Information System, Spatial Relation, Spatial Ability, Spatial Knowledge"
1992,Temporal databases,"This paper summarizes the major concepts, approaches, and implementation strategies that have been generated over the last fifteen years of research into data base management system support for time-varying information. We first examine the time domain, its structure, dimensionality, indeterminacy, and representation. We then discuss how facts may be associated with time, and consider data modeling and representational issues. We survey the many temporal query languages that have been proposed. Finally, we examine the impact to each of the components of a DBMS of adding temporal support, focusing on query optimization and evaluation.","Query Language, Relational Algebra, Query Optimization, Valid Time, Temporal Database"
1992,People manipulate objects (but cultivate fields): Beyond the raster-vector debate in GIS,"The ongoing debate in GIS regarding the relative merits of vector versus raster representations of spatial information is usually couched in technical terms. Yet the technical question of the most appropriate data structure begs the philosophical question of the most appropriate conceptualization of geographic space. The paper confronts this latter question in the context of the opposition between the “object” and “field” views of space. I suggest that GIS can turn a rather dry debate into a source of insights regarding the nature of its subject matter by learning from how people actually experience and deal with the geographic world. Human cognition indeed appears to make use of both the object and field views, but at different geographic scales, and for different purposes. These observations suggest a list of desiderata for the next round of thinking about spatial representation in GIS.","Geographic Scale, Spatial Cognition, Geographic Space, Field View, Geographic Entity"
1992,Time and space:An economic model,"Technology enables us to assemble ever and ever larger quantities of data and ever deepening data structures. These developments are not sufficient. Humans must have stories, images, habits and rules-of-thumb to live by and with in complex environments and they are just not available as they relate to the globe which is shared by all. Simply browsing through a world atlas or looking at a globe is an exercise in looking at more information than it is possible to handle at once. The remote sensing and geographic information system communities have the opportunity to engage in the construction of tools which, in their maturity, will enable new ways of comprehending our global state of affairs. The purpose of the paper which follows is to contribute to a framework for such an undertaking.","Remote Sensing, Geographic Information System, Subsistence Economy, Manufacturing Employment, Average Farm Size"
1992,The changing language of and persisting patterns in the urban design of Edo/Tokyo,"The city is an environment formed by the interaction and integration of different practices. The practices of the city involved a great number of individuals and social groups whose cosmologies are different and whose interests are in conflict.

In this paper, the author attempts to analyse the changing signification and persisting vernacular elements of the urban design of Tokyo (called Edo up till 1868) since its beginnings in the seventeenth century.

Topography was the most important factor in the urban design of this period: alluvial plains and reclaimed land were designated for the commercial and residential use of the commoners (these districts being referred to as the shitamachi) and the diluvial, hilly parts (referred to as the yamanote) were assigned to the feudal lords and their samurai subjects as residential quarters.

Destruction caused by the Kanto earthquake in 1923 and ensuing reconstruction plans were epochal inducements towards the transforming of Tokyo from a canal city into a land-traffic city. Nonetheless, most of the popular commercial centres continued to be found at the junctions of canal traffic systems and at sacred places, where moats and panoramas dominated by distantly seen symbolic mountains (Fuji and Tsukuba) were important elements.","Urban Space, Flame Spread, Urban Design, Urban Structure, Residential District"
1992,Toward a behavioral theory of regionalization,This paper addresses the problem of regionalization from a social science perspective. The author presents a theory of regionalization based on an elementary model of human action. Regions are classified according to the various phases of adaptive human behavior which they represent. The dynamism of regions is shown to derive from the interaction of these phases. Examples are given of how regions generate regions. The paper calls attention to the often unanticipated political consequences of scientific regionalization.,"Great Plain, Cultural Region, Optative Region, Optative Projection, Prescriptive Region"
1992,Descriptive modeling and prescriptive modeling in spatial data handling,"Descriptive and prescriptive modeling are here proposed to devise general and comprehensive Spatial Information Systems, which broaden the role of spatial data modeling from relatively passive inquiry to much more active intent. Descriptive modeling corresponds to a bottom up approach to spatial data organization, and provides tools to extract prominent features from the low level geometric model. Prescriptive modeling involves two aspects: exploration and generation. Exploration of a high level description of spatial data is performed to allocate stated geographical configurations, while the generation of low level descriptive models supports the simulation of geographical phenomena. An implementation of the proposed system architecture is presented with examples of both descriptive and prescriptive modeling in the context of digital terrain modeling.","Spatial Data, Geometric Model, Digital Terrain Modeling, Stochastic Perturbation, Symbolic Description"
1992,The geometry of environmental knowledge,"Theoretical and empirical work on the geometry of environmental knowledge is discussed. Certain patterns of distance and directional estimates collected from humans have been interpreted as being due to non-metric or non-Euclidean spatial knowledge. I argue that attempts to determine this geometry are inconsistent with existing theoretical models of human knowledge storage and use. Spatial estimation data are more parsimoniously explained as resulting from: (a) measurement error and ambiguity, (b) multiple and uncoordinated long-term memory representations, and (c) processes taking place when spatial knowledge is activated and used.","Work Memory, Euclidean Geometry, Spatial Knowledge, Estimation Task, Environmental Knowledge"
1992,Spatial reasoning using symbolic arrays,"Research in Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science has suggested the distinction between visual knowledge (such as shape, volume and colour of objects) and spatial knowledge (that is, spatial relationships among the different objects of a visual scene). We find this distinction applicable to Information Systems concerned with spatial reasoning and especially to Geographic Information Systems. In particular, this paper deals with the representation of spatial information in GIS. The paper presents a representational formalism which captures the knowledge embedded in spatial relationships and provides the ability to represent, retrieve and reason about spatial information not explicitly stored in memory.","Geographic Information System, Spatial Relationship, Knowledge Representation, Spatial Representation"
1992,Using orientation information for qualitative spatial reasoning,A new approach to representing qualitative spatial knowledge and to spatial reasoning is presented. This approach is motivated by cognitive considerations and is based on relative orientation information about spatial environments. The approach aims at exploiting properties of physical space which surface when the spatial knowledge is structured according to conceptual neighborhood of spatial relations. The paper introduces the notion of conceptual neighborhood and its relevance for qualitative temporal reasoning. The extension of the benefits to spatial reasoning is suggested. Several approaches to qualitative spatial reasoning are briefly reviewed. Differences between the temporal and the spatial domain are outlined. A way of transferring a qualitative temporal reasoning method to the spatial domain is proposed. The resulting neighborhood-oriented representation and reasoning approach is presented and illustrated. An example for an application of the approach is discussed.,"Spatial Relation, Road Segment, Spatial Knowledge, Relation Space, Spatial Reasoning"
1992,The observer's point of view: An extension of symbolic projections,"Spatial reasoning is normally concerned with various methods for reasoning in images that in many cases are symbolic, like for instance, maps. The goal is to identify complex object relations by means of methods operating on a high abstraction level. Several approaches to spatial reasoning have been proposed and one such method is symbolic projections which is closely related to qualitative reasoning. The method that will be discussed here is an extension of symbolic projections that specifically is concerned with the observer's point of view. In other words, the work presented here is concerned with qualitative methods for determination of, among other things, directions, distances and other object relations seen from the observer's perspective, i.e. the projections are in the majority of cases concerned with a singular point.","Slope Coefficient, Point Object, Supporting Line, Spatial Reasoning, Extended Object"
1992,Reasoning about gradual changes of topological relationships,"Geographic objects and phenomena may gradually change their location, orientation, shape, and size over time. A qualitative change occurs if the deformation of an object affects its topological relationship with respect to another object. The observation of such changes is particularly interesting, because qualitative changes frequently require different decisions or trigger new actions. Investigations of a closed set of mutually exclusive binary topological relationships led to a formal model to determine for each topological relationship the relationships closest to it. Applied to the entire set of binary topological relationships between spatial regions, this model describes a partial order over topological relationships and provides a measure to assess how far two relationships are apart from each other. The changes to the binary topological relationship caused by such deformations as translation, rotation, reduction, and expansion of an object are mapped onto this graph. The graphs show characteristic traverses for each kind of deformation. Using these characteristic traverses as knowledge about deformations, one can infer from multiple observations the kind of deformation that caused the change and predict the next topological relationship. Particularly, it provides answers to three kinds of qualitative space-time inferences: (1) Given a process and a state, what is the next most likely state? (2) Given an ordered pair of states, what process may have occurred? (3) Given an ordered pair of states and a process, in what states must the two objects have been in between?","Topological Change, Geographic Space, Topological Relation, Logical Relationship, Topological Relationship"
1992,The meaning of “neighbour”,"Traditional vector and raster spatial models as used in many computer systems are examined to determine what is meant by the term “neighbour”. The limitations are examined and the Voronoi spatial model is proposed as a consistent alternative to both. It is then asked whether this new computer model of space bears any resemblance to human spatial reasoning and perception processes. Examination of the work of Blum, Ahuja, Tuceryan, Serra and others suggests that the Voronoi model may indeed relate to visual perception and the concept of “neighbour”.","Voronoi Diagram, Medial Axis, Boundary Segment, Spatial Reasoning, Voronoi Region"
1992,A hierarchical triangle-based model for terrain description,"This article describes a new hierarchical model for representing a terrain. The model, called a Hierarchical Triangulated Irregular Network (HTIN), is a method for compression of spatial data and representation of a topographic surface at successively finer levels of detail. A HTIN is a hierarchy of triangle-based surface approximations, where each node, except for the root, is a triangulated irregular network refining a triangle face belonging to its parent in the hierarchy. In this paper we present an encoding structure for a HTIN and we describe an algorithm for its construction.","Delaunay Triangulation, Boundary Edge, Adjacent Triangle, Triangulate Irregular Network, Constrain Delaunay Triangulation"
1992,A model for expressing topological integrity constraints in geographic databases,"A major reccuring issue in spatial databases is that of handling topological relationships. Although topology can be determined from object positions it is often explicitly stored in geographic information systems for reasons of efficiency and integrity. No formal database models for expressing topological relationships at the conceptual and logical levels are available. This paper describes such a model by defining geographic objects, geometric types, and elementary spatial operations and relationships. The model can be used to express topological integrity constraints, to define geographic object classes and to express spatial queries. Examples are given on how to use the model for the whole cycle of design and development of a geographic application, including requirements analysis, conceptual and logical modeling and implementation.","Object Class, Integrity Constraint, Geographic Information System, Topological Relationship, Land Parcel"
1992,Encoding spatial information: The evidence for hierarchical processing,"This paper describes how individuals process spatial information, how geographical location can affect the method of processing, how an understanding of spatial information processing is necessary to model spatial choices accurately, and how spatial variations in the way information is processed can be measured. Both nonhierarchical and hierarchical methods of processing information are discussed with the latter being the more likely means of processing spatial information. Results from an empirical example using migration flows within the U.S. suggest that individuals use a hierarchical method of spatial ordering and that there is a spatial pattern to the degree to which spatial information is processed hierarchically. This pattern is shown to be related to the amount of spatial information available to an individual.","Spatial Information, Migration Flow, Central Origin, Hierarchical Theory, Distance Judgement"
1992,Is there a relationship between spatial cognition and environmental patterns?,"One aspect of a fundamental theory of spatial representations is human-cognitive representation. This research includes a review of cognitive models of spatial knowledge across disciplines, upon which a proposed comprehensive model is based. This model includes geographic facts, route, and configurational knowledge as kinds of (spatial) geographical knowledge. This research also investigates the acquisition of spatial knowledge. An experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that a regular environment (gridded road pattern) promotes the acquisition of metrical configurational knowledge from procedural knowledge and greater navigation experience, whereas an irregular environment (serpentine road pattern) does not. A irregular and regular environment were used in this study. Forty subjects performed orientation, distance, and location estimation tasks in each environment, and performance was compared. The results of the experiment were varied. There was, however, tentative support to suggest that the pattern of the environment does effect the accuracy of spatial knowledge.","Spatial Ability, Spatial Knowledge, Spatial Task, Knowledge Type, Geographical Knowledge"
1992,Counter-intuitive geographic ‘facts’: Clues for spatial reasoning at geographic scales,"‘Counter-intuitive’ geographic facts provide insight into spatial reasoning at geographic scales. Situations that are judged as counter-intuitive by many people probably result from ‘correct’ spatial reasoning based of distorted spatial knowledge that is common to populations. Systematic distortions of latitude and longitude are examined by asking subjects to judge whether certain cities were east or west (or, north or south) of a common city. When the proportion judging each city to be a certain direction is mapped, the isolines reveal systematic distortions of geographic configurations that are consistent with hierarchical knowledge representation and several prototype effects.","Geographic Fact, Spatial Reasoning, Systematic Distortion, Panama Canal, Geographic Knowledge"
1992,Spatial-linguistic reasoning in LEI,"In LEI, the Locality and Elevation Interpreter, lingusitic and geometric reasoning are joined to resolve natural language representations of locations as geodetic coordinates. The system uses the PAU (Parser and Understander) system to translate locality descriptions into semantic relations. The relations are then disambiguated by instantiation from USGS data bases. The project's goal is to replace operator intervention in locality interpretation.","Syntactic Category, Spatial Reasoning, Prepositional Phrase, Grammar Rule, Ground Object"
1992,User models and information theory in the design of a query interface for GIS,"The design of user interfaces has lacked a firm theoretical foundation. A solid user interface theory would be particularily helpful in complex systems, such as GIS. Information theory and user modelling are presented here as a promising approach to building such a theory. Their applicability is considered in the context of querying a geographical database. Different theories of information are reviewed and some misunderstandings are corrected. Any communication can be examined on three different levels: syntactic, semantic and pragmatic. The syntactic information of a message is its relative frequency within language without any concern for the meaning of the message. The semantic information content of a message is defined as how many different states of the universe distinguishable in the language it excludes logically. The pragmatic information is the personal meaning of the message to the sender and the receiver. User modelling methodology is presented as a way to handle pragmatic information. Research into user models is reviewed and the potential of GIS applications and further study are investigated.","Geographical Information System, Semantic Information, User Model, Query Interface, Syntactic Information"
1992,A conceptual model of wayfinding using multiple levels of abstraction,"Wayfinding is part of everyday life. This study concentrates on the development of a conceptual model of human navigation in the U.S. Interstate Highway Network. It proposes three different levels of conceptual understanding that constitute the cognitive map: the Planning Level, the Instructional Level, and the Driver Level. This paper formally defines these three levels and examines the conceptual objects that comprise them. The problem treated here is a simpler version of the open problem of planning and navigating a multi-mode trip. We expect the methods and preliminary results found here for the Interstate system to apply to other systems such as river transportation networks and railroad networks.","Conceptual Model, Geographic Information System, Spatial Reasoning, Railroad Network, Planning Level"
1992,Towards acquiring spatio-temporal knowledge from sensor data,"This paper presents an architecture for acquiring spatio-temporal knowledge. This architecture uses two different algorithms — generalization to interval (GTI) method and feature construction method — for learning from sensory/perceptual information. These methods generalize over positive/negative examples of target knowledge, and output a constraint program that can be used declaratively as a learned concept about spatio-temporal patterns, and procedurally as a method for reasoning about spatio-temporal relations. Thus our methods transform numeric spatio-temporal patterns to symbolic declarative/procedural representations. We have implemented these two algorithms with acorn, a system that acquires spatio-temporal knowledge by observing examples. In this paper, we give two examples from different domains -layout problems and robot-commands learning — to demonstrate the ability of the system and the flexibility of constraint programs for knowledge representation.","Spatial Relation, Constraint Program, Symbolic Representation, Layout Problem, Target Concept"
1992,Automatically acquiring knowledge by digital maps in artificial intelligence planning techniques,"Any ES research, in particular planner ES research, shows that knowledge acquisition is a bottleneck when building up the ES prototypes. From this viewpoint, the possibility of automatically acquiring knowledge for ES, at least with reference to special themes and problems, may be seen as constituting an interesting line of research.

Inductive and EBL methodologies, founded on quantitative and qualitative knowledge, are the main contributions that the ML (a branch of AI) makes to the above mentioned goal. Both approaches, even if very little investigated in the planning domain, seem to invite further research.

We refer in particular to the potentials of automatically learning by maps. Relating to the research on planner ES prototypes for urban environmental control, this paper intends to set up a preliminary discussion on the perspectives offered by the automatic interpretation of key variables in order to make elementary inferences concerning urban typologies and situations.","Contour Line, Environmental Category, Symbolic Description, Automatic Learning, Interval Domain"
1992,Machine induction of geospatial knowledge,"Machine learning techniques such as tree induction have become accepted tools for developing generalisations of large data sets, typically for use with production rule systems in prediction and classification. The advent of computer based cartography and the field of geographic information systems (GIS) has seen a wealth of spatial data generated and used for decision making and modelling. We examine the implications of inductive techniques applied to geospatial data in a logical framework. It is argued that spatial induction systems will benefit from the ability to extend their initial representation language, through feature and relation construction. The enormous search spaces involved imply a need for strong biasing techniques to control the generation of possible representations of the data for all but the most trivial of cases. A heavily constrained geospatial domain, topographic representation, is described as one simplified example of induction across a vector description of space.","Geographic Information System, Learning System, Geospatial Data, Declarative Knowledge"
1992,Treatment of qualitative geographic information in monitoring environmental pollution,"The inverse problem of material sources identification, with particular reference to air polluting sources and their detection from experimental data, is a difficult task to solve and it is classified as a typical illposed problem. The traditional approach to these problems uses the additional information available on the system in order to limit the number of solutions consistent with the data by means of regularization techniques. In this paper we propose a method that allows to find reliable solutions by treating qualitative spatial and geographic information. It is shown how to code in a general fuzzy optimization algorithm the experimental knowledge, quantitative models and the a-priori knowledge about territory configuration such as urban areas, lakes, parks and high-traffic motorways. The architecture of an automatic system that allows to handle the coupled qualitative and quantitative knowledge about the system is presented.","Membership Function, Solution Domain, Regularization Technique, Fuzzy Optimization, Fuzzy Constraint"
2001,A Geographer Looks at Spatial Information Theory,"Geographic information is defined as a subset of spatial information, specific to the spatiotemporal frame of the Earth’s surface. Thus geographic information theory inherits the results of spatial information theory, but adds results that reflect the specific properties of geographic information. I describe six general properties of geographic information, and show that in some cases specialization has assumed other properties that are less generally observed. A recognition of the distinction between geographic and spatial would allow geographic information theory to achieve greater depth and utility.","Geographic Information, Spatial Dependence, Geographically Weight Regression, Geographic Information System, Impossible World"
2001,True Grid,"The Renaissance architect, moral philosopher, cryptographer, mathematician, Papal adviser, painter, city planner and land surveyor Leon Battista Alberti provided the theoretical foundations of modern perspective geometry. Alberti’s work on perspective exerted a powerful influence on painters of the stature of Albrecht Dürer, Leonardo da Vinci and Piero della Francesca. But his Della pittura of 1435-36 contains also a hitherto unrecognized ontology of pictorial projection. We sketch this ontology, and show how it can be generalized to apply to represantive devices in general, including maps and spatial and non-spatial databases.","Linear Perspective, Objective Array, Target Grid, Transparent Grid, Fiat Object"
2001,A Taxonomy of Granular Partitions,"In this paper we propose a formal theory of granular partitions (ways of dividing up or sorting or mapping reality) and we show how the theory can be applied in the geospatial domain. We characterize granular partitions at two levels: as systems of cells, and in terms of their projective relation to reality. We lay down conditions of well-formedness for granular partitions, and we define what it means for partitions to project transparently onto reality in such a way as to be structure-preserving. We continue by classifying granular partitions along three axes, according to: (a) the degree to which a partition represents the mereological structure of the domain it is projected onto; (b) the degree of completeness and exhaustiveness with which a partition represents reality; and (c) the degree of redundancy in the partition structure. This classification is used to characterize three types of granular partitions that play an important role in spatial information science: cadastral partitions, categorical coverages, and the partitions involved in folk categorizations of the geospatial domain.","Categorical Coverage, Minimal Cell, Attribute Domain, Master Condition, Spatial Partition"
2001,A Geometric Theory of Vague Boundaries Based on Supervaluation,"The representation of geographical objects with vague or fuzzy boundaries still poses a challenge to current geographical information systems. The paper presents a geometric account to deal with spatial vagueness. This approach is based on ideas of the theory of supervaluation. To capture vague spatial information current geographical information systems mainly employ fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic. The proposed geometric theory is contrasted with fuzzy theories regarding the representation of vague spatial objects and the inferences that can be drawn about the objects. Opposed to fuzzy theories, the proposed theory does not rely on a numerical representation to model spatial vagueness, but is still compatible with it. Therefore, the approach is able to support spatial databases in qualitative spatial inferences.","Axiomatics, Geometry, Geography, Spatial Reasoning, Vagueness"
2001,When Tables Tell It All: Qualitative Spatial and Temporal Reasoning Based on Linear Orderings,"In [8] Bennett, Isli and Cohn put out the following challenge to researchers working with theories based on composition tables (CT): give a general characterization of theories and relational constraint languages for which a complete proof procedure can be specified by a CT. For theories based on CTs, they make the distinction between a weak, consistency-based interpretation of the CT, and a stronger extensional definition. In this paper, we take up a limited aspect of the challenge, namely, we characterize a subclass of formalisms for which the weak interpretation can be related in a canonical way to a structure based on a total ordering, while the strong interpretations have the property of aleph-zero categoricity (all countable models are isomorphic).

Our approach is based on algebraic, rather than logical, methods. It can be summarized by two keywords: relation algebra and weak representation.","temporal reasoning, spatial reasoning, relation algebra, weak representation, complete theory"
2001,Computational structure in three-valued nearness relations,"The development of cognitively plausible models of human spatial reasoning may ultimately result in computational systems that are better equipped to meet human needs. This paper explores how human subjects perceive the qualitative spatial relation nearness within an environmental space. Based on experimental data, a three-valued nearness relation is analysed in two stages. First, the results are analysed with special reference to the existence of subsets of candidate landmark places, from which nearness relations between other places may be partially inferred. Second, the desirable properties of such landmark sets are considered and some of their formal properties are presented. These properties are then considered in the light of the data furnished by the experiment. The paper concludes with a discussion of the significance of the analyses and the scope for further work in this area.","Nearness, qualitative spatial reasoning, landmarks, data mining, similarity relation"
2001,Qualitative Spatio-Temporal Continuity,We explore different intuitive notions of spatio-temporal continuity and give a formal characterization of continuity for space-time histories. We investigate the types of transitions possible for the RCC-8 topological relations under each distinct notion of spatio-temporal continuity and provide a hierarchy of conceptual neighbourhood diagrams.,"spatio-temporal reasoning, continuity, space-time, transitions, conceptual neighbourhoods"

2001,Spatial and Cognitive Simulation with Multi-agent Systems,"The simulation of human behavior in space is an extremely interesting and powerful research method to advance our understanding of human spatial cognition and the interaction of human beings with the environment. Multi-agent systems are an emerging computing paradigm for the construction of such simulations. During the last two years, we have used multiagent simulations for three different investigations of spatial and cognitive questions:

use of signage in airports to guide travelers to the gate,

communication with maps,

linkage between physical reality and the cadastral (legal) system.

In this paper we will report on these efforts. We first discuss the concept of multi-agent systems and explain the special type of multi-agent system used for simulation of cognitive and spatial situations. The following three sections each review one of the three simulations we have constructed. The last section identifies the similarities in these approaches and lists questions we hope to investigate in the future with this method.","Spatial cognition, multi-agent simulation, computational models"
2001,A Virtual Test Bed in Support of Cognitively-Aware Geomatics Technologies,"Current efforts concerned with research at the interface between cognitive science and geographic information science or geomatics is beginning to shift towards a larger focus on how the theory developed may be applied to concrete applications. In order to provide some quality control on the development and evaluation of cognitively-aware geomatics systems and technologies, this paper proposes to consolidate current theory into a virtual test bed. The virtual test bed requires an appropriate and adequate categorization of spatial cognitive behaviors, itself a non-trivial task. In addition, the test bed must be sufficiently general to evaluate different kinds of cognitively aware systems. In this paper, three characteristics of such systems are discussed – their plausibility, their compatibility and their scope. The relationships between these concepts and the Turing test are also explored. A tentative categorization scheme, based on information processing needs, is then proposed as an initial framework for developing a virtual test bed. Several design issues are also presented, and the paper finishes with the presentation of two case studies that illustrate how the test bed might be used.","Spatial cognition, geomatics, geographic information science, computation, evaluation, technologies, systems, applications"
2001,Evaluating the Usability of the Scale Metaphor for Querying Semantic Spaces,"Information visualizations have become popular tools for extracting knowledge from large bodies of information. Very little is known on the usability of such ‘visual knowledge tools’ for information access. The goal of this paper is to show the usability of the spatial metaphor ‘scale’ to access a large semantic document space. An experiment was conducted to examine whether different user groups can associate graphical changes in resolution in spatialized views with changes of level of detail in an index hierarchy of a digital document collection. Test participants were asked to utilize zoom tools to explore a spatialized subset of the GeoRef database, an extensive collection of geology and earth sciences documents. The outcomes of the experiment suggest that people are able to associate graphical changes in resolution of spatialized views (zooms) with changes in levels of detail of a document collection (hierarchical order). These results are independent of user group membership, but for some displays it takes people longer to make a decision.","Spatialization, scale, usability, semantic spaces, spatial metaphors"
2001,A Semantic Map as Basis for the Decision Process in the www Navigation,"In the physical world, decision making in common navigation strategies is based on a mental map which includes a mental representation of geometric features such as distances and directions between places. We propose that decision making in the web is also based on a mental map. Contrary to the physical world navigation, the mental map used for web navigation describes a part of the agent’s epistemology of the world, hence consists of semantic relations between concepts and includes hardly any geometrical features. We focus on the navigation situation where the detailed web structure is unknown to the agent before the navigation, therefore the agent’s decisions are completely based on his semantic mental map. We give a potential structure of the agent’s mental map, simulated using WordNet, and simulate the agent’s decision making process during the web navigation. The simulation of the strategies allows to assess existing web environments with regard to ease of navigability.","semantic map, web navigation strategy, decision process, epistemology, web searching"
2001,Pragmatism and Spatial Layout Design,"Design problems address multiple, ill-defined goals in a computationally intractable search space. Our approach to spatial layout design capitalizes on devices that people use to control search. We advocate multiple passes at increasing, class-based levels of granularity, with heavy infusions of knowledge. Our approach makes brief, inexpensive searches from good starting points, seeking ideas that satisfy multiple criteria simultaneously. The result is an autonomous program for two-dimensional layout design of recreational parks.","spatial design, constraint-based reasoning, cognitive structure of spatial knowledge, social and cultural organization of space, structure of geographic information"
2001,Spatial Frames of Reference Used in Identifying Direction of Movement: An Unexpected Turn,"Despite extensive interest in the role of frames of reference in spatial representation, there is little consensus regarding the cognitive effort associated with various reference systems and the cognitive costs (if any) involved in switching from one frame of reference to another. Relevant to these issues an experiment was conducted in which accuracy and response latency data were collected in a task in which observers verified the direction of turns made by a model car in a mock city in terms of four different spatial frames of reference: fixed-observer (relative-egocentric), fixed-environmental object (intrinsic-fixed), mobile object (intrinsic-mobile), and cardinal directions (absolute-global). Results showed that frames of reference could be differentiated on the basis of response accuracy and latency. In addition, no cognitive costs were observed in terms of accuracy or latency when the frames of reference switched between fixed-observer vs. global frames of reference or between mobile object and fixed environmental object frames of reference. Instead, a distinct performance advantage was observed when frames of reference were changed. This unexpected result is attributed to a phenomenon analogous to release from proactive inhibition.","frames of reference, orientation, spatial perspective, spatial relations"
2001,The Role of a Self-Reference System in Spatial Navigation,"The self-reference system architecture developed to explain the retrieval of spatial knowledge from long-term memory is reviewed and expanded to include navigational tracking as one of its operations. A distinction is made between the operation of the self-reference system at a perceptual-motor and a representational level, and a case is made that if a representational self-reference system is to function as a navigational tracking device, it must be closely connected with the perceptual-motor level. Existing empirical evidence is reviewed and new empirical evidence is reported that explores the connections between the two levels of functioning. Additionally, the operations that would enable a self-reference system to function as a tracking device are derived from an animal model of sense of direction. The ideas explored in this manuscript rely on the premise that spatial memory systems evolved in the service of spatial navigation.","Self-reference system, navigational tracking device, cognitive map, geocentric heading, path integration, inertial dead reckoning"
2001,The Utility of Global Representations in a Cognitive Map,"In this paper we propose the use of small global memory for a viewer’s immediate surroundings to assist in recognising places that have been visited previously. We call this global memory a Memory for the Immediate Surroundings (MFIS). Our previous work [1, 2] on building a cognitive map has focused on computing a representation for the different local spaces the viewer visits. The different local spaces which are computed can be connected together in the way they are experienced to form a topological network which is one aspect of a cognitive map of the spatial environment. The problem with topological representations is that using them one cannot easily detect that one is reentering a previously visited part of the environment if it is approached from a different side to the one used previously. Thus we have developed a cognitive map representation which comprises an MFIS working in cooperation with the topological network. The idea that a global map is present as part of the cognitive mapping process is increasingly appealing. Robotics researchers have used them from the early days of autonomous mobile robots. However, they have shown that it is difficult to compute an accurate global representation because of errors. There is now increasing evidence that a global map is used in animals and many simulation models have incorporated the use of such a map. In this paper we review these works, discuss this notion of a global map in cognitive mapping, and show how one could be computed with minimum effort.","cognitive map, path integration, global spatial representation, local spatial representation"
2001,How Spoken Language and Signed Language Structure Space Differently,"Linguistic research to date has determined many of the factors that structure the spatial schemas found across spoken languages. It is now feasible to integrate these factors and to determined the comprehensive system they constitute for spatial structuring in spoken language. This system is characterized by several features: It has a relatively closed universally available inventory of fundamental spatial elements that are combined to form whole schemas. It has a relatively closed set of categories that these elements appear in. And it has a relatively closed small number of particular elements in each category, hence, of spatial distinctions that each category can ever mark. An examination of signed language shows that its structural representation of space systematically differes from that in spoken language in the direction of what appear to be the structural characteristics of scene parsing in visual perception. Such differences include the following: Signed language can mark finer spatial distinctions with its inventory of more structural elements, more categories, and more elements per category. It represent these distinctions independently in the expression, not bundled together into “pre-packaged” schemas. And its spatial representations are largely iconic with visible spatial characteristics. The findings suggest that instead of some discrete whole-language module, spoken language and signed language are both based on some more limited core linguistic system that then connects with different further subsystems for the full funtioning of the two different language modalities.","Language Modality, Ground Object, Spatial Schema, Spatial Element, Signed Language"
2001,Two Path Preposition: Along and Past,"We present results from a series of experiments, where relevant factors for theuse of path prepositions were examined. We were especially interested in the concepts behind the German prepositions “entlang” and “vorbei” (similar to “along” and “past”). After exploring the basic properties human beings attribute to these prepositions, we systematically varied those properties to investigate their impact on the selection process and the corresponding speech production latency. The results indicate that parallelism and distance between the outline of a reference object and a trajectory are key concepts in this context.","communication of spatial information, spatial reasoning, empirical studies, path prepositions"
2001,Ambiguity in Acquiring Spatial Representation from Descriptions Compared to Depictions: The Role of Spatial Orientation,"Adults can make judgments about multiple spatial relations based on information gained from different kinds of input, including maps, descriptions, and through navigation [1]. However, factors such as spatial orientation influence performance. We investigated spatial orientation effects on learning from different media. In Experiment 1, participants learned a house from a map or a description. They then judged surrounding locations while imagining being in each room and they reconstructed the house. Participants who learned from a description performed worse on both tasks. Errors suggested they interpreted the term “in front” differently than intended [2]. Experiment 2 tested this hypothesis by examining two factors influencing interpretation of “in front”, specific interpretation instructions and orientation information. The orientation information influenced performance more than the explicit interpretation of “in front.” Taken together, the results indicate multiple influences on the spatial reference frame participants use to interpret spatial terms.","spatial descriptions, reference frame, spatial orientation, map use, spatial judgments, perspective taking"
2001,When and Why Are Visual Landmarks Used in Giving Directions?,"Route directions describe the sequence of actions a moving person needs to take to reach a goal in an environment. When generating directions, speakers not only specify what to do. They also refer to landmarks located along the route. We report two studies intended to identify the cognitive functions of landmarks. In the first study, participants learned a route in an urban environment. They then generated route directions to help pedestrians unfamiliar with this environment to find their way. We found that landmarks were reported more frequently at specific points on the route, especially at reorientation points. The second study showed that pedestrians perceived landmarks as a useful part of route directions. We conclude that reference to landmarks is intended to help movers to construct a mental representation of an unfamiliar environment in advance and to prepare them cognitively to get through difficult or uncertain parts of that environment.","Landmarks, spatial cognition, route directions, urban environment, navigation"
2001,Recognition of Abstract Regions in Cartographic Maps,"In the human interpretation of cartographic maps the areas we shall call abstract regions consist of several symbols (map objects), which are grouped to a single object. This abstraction process is an important part of human map interpretation. Abstract regions exist as mental objects in a mental map in the interpreter’s mind. In this article we describe an approach to automate the human process of recognizing abstract regions in cartographic maps by technical processes. We designed and implemented a system for defining abstract regions by hierarchical descriptions. The hierarchies are represented by attributed grammars that can be translated by a compilercompiler to yield a parser for abstract regions. With this parser, abstract region candidates that were identified by simple rules can be evaluated to check if they conform to the definition provided by the user. Our approach combines cognitive considerations on human abstraction with techniques from theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.","cognitive modeling, formal methods, map generalization, map interpretation, region abstraction, spatial concepts"
2001,Geographical Information Retrieval with Ontologies of Place,"Geographical context is required of many information retrieval tasks in which the target of the search may be documents, images or records which are referenced to geaographical space only by means of place names. Often there may be an imprecise match between the query name and the names associated with the candidate sources of information. There is a need therefore for geographical information retrieval facilities that can rank the relevance of candidate information with respect to geographical closeness as well as semantic closeness with respect to the topic of interest. Here we present an ontology of place that combines limited coordinate data with qualitative spatial relationships between places. This parsimonious model of place is intended to support information retrieval tasks that may be global in scope. The ontology has been implemented with a semantic modelling system linking non-spatial conceptual hierarchies with the place ontology. An hierachical distance measure is combined with Euclidean distance between place centroids to create a hybrid spatial distance measure. This can be combined with thematic distance, based on classification semantics, to create an integrated semantic closeness measure that can be used for a relevance ranking of retrieved objects.","relevance ranking, similarity measures, thesauri, gazetteers"
2001,Qualitative Spatial Representation for Information Retrieval by Gazetteers,"Intelligent and efficient information retrieval becomes increasingly important. Analogous to thesauri in the realm of spatial concepts, gazetteers offer a controlled vocabulary that can be used for spatial queries. Gazetteers use geographic footprints to link place names to geographic locations. Which geographic footprint representation is chosen has a strong impact on the quality of spatial queries. However, the footprint representations currently used in standard gazetteers such as points, lines, grid cell representations, and bounding boxes do not offer enough topological information to support refined spatial queries. We propose a new type of spatial footprint that can be described as a qualitative representation of the spatial decomposition of geographic entities. It holds enough topological and ordinal information enable refined spatial queries without being subject to the constraints of exact polygon representations. The proposed spatial representation was developed to be combined with terminological reasoning techniques used in systems for intelligent information integration.","Spatial Reasoning, Gazetteers, Information Retrieval and Inference, Semantic Interoperability"
2001,Spatial representation and updating: Evidence from neuropsychological investigations,"How spatial information is represented and updated over time and over changes in the position of the stimulus and/or obrserver is considered in the context of a population of patients who have impairment in spatial perception. We present data both from our own research with patients suffering from hemispatial neglect as well as from studies in the literature. Taken together, these studies suggest that spatial information is coded in more than one spatial frame of reference simultaneously and that the choice of reference frame depends on the demands of the tasks. Once the stimulus is located, however, the patients are able to update the position of the stimulus dynamically when walking or when undergoing passive rotation. The insights obtained from this neuropsychological population provides converging evidence for the psychological and neural mechanisms which mediate spatial representation and dovetail well with existing single unit recording and functional imaging data.","Spatial representation, Spatial updating, Spatial reference frames, Neuropsychology, Hemispatial neglect"
2001,Mental Processing of Geographic Knowledge,"The contribution presents a computational modeling approach to geographic knowledge processing in mind. Geographic knowledge is assumed to be stored in a piecemeal manner. Spatial knowledge fragments form a hierarchical structure of lean knowledge. An actual mental image representation is constructed when needed to perform a specific task. In this construction process missing information is complemented to create a determinate mental image. – First, the artificial intelligence perspective taken is elaborated. After a short review of conceptions on mental processing of spatial knowledge from psychology and artificial intelligence we outline the model MIRAGE. The internal structure and the operating of the model is elaborated using an exemplary scenario. Problems in constructing mental images from given pieces of knowledge are demonstrated and discussed. The paper concludes with a discussion of the approach with respect to its modeling objective. We point to further research questions and to potential applications.","Cognitive maps, spatial knowledge construction, mental imagery, diagrammatic reasoning, experimental computational modeling"
2001,Spatial Cognition and the Processing of Verticality in Underground Environments,"Verticality is a relevant feature in many environments. Despite its relevance, little is known about how it is processed. In work conducted with the RATP, we approached this problem by comparing three forms of graphic aids intended to provide information about the vertical dimension of subway stations. These graphic representations were : floorplans of each level of the station, the same floorplans associated with a frontal view of the station and a three-dimensional axonometric representation of the station. Use of these representations was compared to learning of the station by navigation. Sixty four persons took part in the experiment. Participants had to perform routes, to locate landmarks and to compare distances. The axonometric representation was found to be the easiest to learn. The results also showed that this representation enabled individuals to perform well on the different tasks by allowing them to elaborate a correct mental representation of the vertical relations between the levels of the station, and between the underground and the outside. Thus, this kind of representation seems to be an efficient navigational aid, allowing users to achieve good planning for their displacements.","spatial cognition, verticality, navigational aids, underground and urban environments"
2001,Grid Patterns and Cultural Expectations in Urban Wayfinding,"Much of the literature on human spatial cognition and language in large-scale environments has been based on ‘simplified’ grid-pattern layouts with orthogonal intersections and parallel paths/streets. However, these are not the prevailing urban structure in many countries. This field study considered the possibility that different cultural expectations for typical urban environments would affect even long-term residents’ mental models and behavior regarding urban wayfinding and locational knowledge. Residents of two grid-pattern cities, one in the UK, where such layouts are rare, and another one in the US, performed a battery of tasks including confidence ratings, sketch map drawing, verbal route directions, and pointing to non-visible landmarks. The results show that the UK group placed less emphasis on the central grid in their sketch maps, and showed a systematic error in their pointing direction. The results are discussed in the light of previous research on orientation biases. Further crosscultural analysis and studies are planned.","route directions, mental maps, cognitive mapping, urban navigation, cross-cultural psychology, pointing tasks, landmarks, cardinal directions"
2001,The House Is North of the River: Relative Localization of Extended Objects,"This article presents a proposal to directional localization of extended objects based on an analysis of the underlying geometric structures. Many existing accounts on the directional localization of objects are based on representing the objects as points. These approaches provide good inferential properties, but are unsuitable to be combined with topological information about the regions occupied by objects. The approach presented here describes directional localization relations on the basis of representing objects as extended regions. Directional localization of an extended region based on a system of sectors and the establishment of a system of sectors based on an extended region are considered independently and the solutions are .nally combined. The investigations yield a geometric characterization of directional localization relations in two-dimensional space that can be applied to objects represented by regions or curves.","Extended objects, relative localization, cardinal directions, qualitative spatial reasoning, incomplete spatial knowledge"
2001,Double-Crossing: Decidability and Computational Complexity of a Qualitative Calculus for Navigation,"The Double Cross calculus has been proposed for the purpose of navigation based on qualitative information about spatial configurations. Up until now, however, no results about algorithmic properties of this calculus are known. First, we explore the possibility of applying constraint propagation techniques to solve the reasoning problem in this calculus. For this purpose, we have to generalize the known techniques for binary relations because the Double Cross calculus is based on ternary relations. We will show, however, that such a generalization leads to problems. The Double Cross calculus is not closed under composition and permutation. Further, as we will show, there exists no finite refinement of the base relations with such a closure property. Finally, we show that determining satisfiability of constraint systems over Double Cross relations is NP-hard, even if only the base relations of the Double Cross calculus are used. On the positive side, however, we show that the reasoning problem is solvable in PSPACE.","languages of spatial relations, spatial and temporal reasoning, incomplete or imprecise spatial knowledge, qualitative spatial reasoning, constraint propagation, ternary relation systems"
2001,Spatial Reasoning: No Need for Visual Information,"One of the central questions of spatial reasoning research is whether the underlying processes are inherently visual or spatial. The article reports a dual-task experiment that was conducted to explore the visual and/or spatial nature of human spatial reasoning. The main tasks were inferences based on a spatial version of the interval calculus introduced by Allen (1983). The secondary tasks were presented visually or acoustically, and were either spatial or non-spatial. The results indicate that spatial reasoning is mainly based on the construction and inspection of spatial layouts, whereas no evidence of the involvement of visual representations and processes was found.","Primary Task, Secondary Task, Mental Imagery, Suppression Condition, Spatial Reasoning"
2001,A Formal Theory of Objects and Fields,"The distinction between object-based and field-based conceptions of geographical reality has become well-known in recent years. It replicates at a conceptual level the distinction between vector-based and raster-based implementation methods for GIS. In this paper I endeavour to lay the groundwork for a careful, mathematically rigorous development of the relevant ideas at the conceptual level. The notions of object and field are given precise mathematical definitions, and an appropriate formal apparatus is constructed by which to address such issues as the interconvertibility of the object-based and field-based paradigms, and their relative adequacy for different representational problems.","model, object, field, raster, vector"
2001,What’s in an Image?,"This paper discusses the ontological status of remote sensing images, from a GIScience perspective. We argue that images have a dual nature—they are fields at the measurement level and fiat objects at the classification level—and that images have an ontological description of their own, distinct and independent from the domain ontology a domain scientist uses. This paper proposes a multi-level ontology for images, combining both field and object approaches and distinguishing between image and user ontologies. The framework developed contributes to the design of a new generation of integrated GISs, since two key benefits are achieved: (1) the support for multiple perspectives for the same image and (2) an emphasis on using images for the detection of spatial-temporal configurations of geographic phenomena.","GIScience, remote sensing images, ontology of geographic data, integrated GIS"
2001,"Features, Objects, and other Things: Ontological Distinctions in the Geographic Domain","Two hundred and sixty-three subjects each gave examples for one of five geographic categories: geographic features, geographic objects, geographic concepts, something geographic, and something that could be portrayed on a map. The frequencies of various responses were significantly different, indicating that the basic ontological terms feature, object, etc., are not interchangeable but carry different meanings when combined with adjectives indicating geographic or mappable. For all of the test phrases involving geographic, responses were predominantly natural features such as mountain, river, lake, ocean, hill. Artificial geographic features such as town and city were listed hardly at all for geographic categories, an outcome that contrasts sharply with the disciplinary self-understanding of academic geography. However, geographic artifacts and fiat objects, such as roads, cities, boundaries, countries, and states, were frequently listed by the subjects responding to the phrase something that could be portrayed on a map. In this paper, we present the results of these experiments in visual form, and provide interpretations and implications for further research.","Geographic ontology, geographic categories, prototypes, spatial cognition, mereotopology, human subjects testing, spatialization, self-organizing maps, geographic information systems, GIS"
2011,How Do Decision Time and Realism Affect Map-Based Decision Making?,"We commonly make decisions based on different kinds of maps, and under varying time constraints. The accuracy of these decisions often can decide even over life and death. In this study, we investigate how varying time constraints and different map types can influence people’s visuo-spatial decision making, specifically for a complex slope detection task involving three spatial dimensions. We find that participants’ response accuracy and response confidence do not decrease linearly, as hypothesized, when given less response time. Assessing collected responses within the signal detection theory framework, we find that different inference error types occur with different map types. Finally, we replicate previous findings suggesting that while people might prefer more realistic looking maps, they do not necessarily perform better with them.","time pressure, slope maps, shaded relief maps, empirical map evaluation"
2011,Towards Cognitively Plausible Spatial Representations for Sketch Map Alignment,"Over the past years user-generated content has gained increasing importance in the area of geographic information science. Private citizens collect environmental data of their neighborhoods and publish it on the web. The wide success of volunteered geographic information relies on the simplicity of such systems. We propose to use sketch maps as a visual user interface, because sketch maps are intuitive, easy to produce for humans and commonly used in human-to-human communication. Sketch maps reflect users’ spatial knowledge that is based on observations rather than on measurements. However, sketch maps, often considered as externalizations of cognitive maps, are distorted, schematized, incomplete, and generalized. Processing spatial information from sketch maps must therefore account for these cognitive aspects. In this paper, we suggest a set of qualitative spatial aspects that should be captured in representations of sketch maps and give empirical evidence that these spatial aspects are robust against typical schematizations and distortions in human spatial knowledge. We propose several existing qualitative spatial calculi to formally represent the spatial aspects, suggest appropriate methods for applying them, and evaluate the proposed representations for alignment of sketch maps and metric maps.","cognitive qualitative representation, sketch map, qualitative spatial reasoning, sketch alignment"
2011,Scalable Navigation Support for Crowds: Personalized Guidance via Augmented Signage,"Navigating unfamiliar places is a common problem people face, and there is a wealth of commercial and research-based applications particularly for mobile devices that provide support in these settings. While many of these solutions work well on an individual level, they are less well suited for very crowded situations, e.g. sports matches, festivals and fairs, or events such as pilgrimages. In a large crowd, attending to a mobile device can be hazardous, the underlying technology might not scale well enough, and some people might be excluded due to not having access to a mobile device. Public signage does not suffer from these issues, and consequently, people frequently rely on signage in crowded settings. However, a key disadvantage of public signage is to not provide personalized navigation support. In this paper, we therefore investigate augmented signage as a means to provide navigation support for large crowds. We introduce a scalable signage-based approach and present results from a comparison study contrasting two designs for augmented signage with a base case. The results provide initial evidence that such a system could be easily useable, may help to reduce task load, and has the potential to improve navigation performance.","Augmented signage, navigation support, crowd interfaces, user studies"
2011,Information on the Consequence of a Move and Its Use for Route Improvisation Support,"This paper proposes a new method of navigational assistance in unfamiliar environments. In such environments, major concerns would normally be how to find a good route to a selected destination and how to design and communicate directions to follow that route. This may not be the case, however, if route selection criteria are not complete or subject to change during a trip. To cope with such uncertainty, the proposed method calculates, for each possible move from the current position, a single value characterizing the consequence of that move, e.g., how long it will take to reach the destination if that move is made. The paper outlines a design of a route improvisation support system equipped with this method, and underlines the merit of letting the user build up a route progressively by taking into account highly local, temporary, or personal information that is not stored in the system but collected by the user while traveling.","Short Path, Navigation System, Short Path Problem, Short Path Length, Short Path Algorithm"
2011,The Effect of Activity on Relevance and Granularity for Navigation,"This paper addresses the role of activity on the construction of route directions. Primary to our conceptualization is that the activity at hand constrains the relevance of spatial information for task performance, as well as the level of granularity at which information is needed. In this paper, we highlight the role of activity for relevance and granularity first based on a review of each of the components involved, and furthermore by a semantic analysis of content patterns in human-generated instructions. The analysis identifies the verbalization styles that are associated with distinct types of activities on the basis of individual keywords that may serve as indicators. We offer a strong theoretical argument for the importance of activities and provide a first step towards an operationalization of this concept, as well as implications for the development of cognitively motivated navigation systems.","Activities, granularity, relevance, navigation, routing, word clouds"
2011,I Can Tell by the Way You Use Your Walk: Real-Time Classification of Wayfinding Performance,"Wayfinding activities often pose difficulty, especially for people with poor spatial abilities. If wayfinding aides can take into account individual differences during navigation, targeted assistance may be able to improve wayfinding performance. To enable this, the performance of wayfinders must first be classified. This work proposes a novel method that uses a probabilistic scoring function to classify wayfinding performance using only information available in real-time during route traversal. Training data for the classifier was algorithmically generated as routes representing different levels of wayfinding performance. This approach was tested through an empirical study in which people with different abilities walked from a start to a goal. The results show that performance of wayfinders can be reliably classified into two groups–good and poor–and that this classification can be done using only information available during route traversal. Our results suggest that environmental structure plays an important role in wayfinders’ route choice.","navigation, route choice, individual differences, spatial cognition, spatial abilities"
2011,From Video to RCC8: Exploiting a Distance Based Semantics to Stabilise the Interpretation of Mereotopological Relations,"Mereotopologies have traditionally been defined in terms of the intersection of point sets representing the regions in question. Whilst these semantic schemes work well for purely topological aspects, they do not give any semantic insight into the degree to which the different mereotopological relations hold. This paper explores this idea of a distance based interpretation for mereotopology. By introducing a distance measure between x and y, and for various Boolean combinations of x and y, we show that all the RCC8 relations can be distinguished. We then introduce a distance measure which combines these individual measures which we show reflect different paths through the RCC8 conceptual neighbourhood – i.e. the measure decreases/increases monotonically given certain monotonic transitions (such as one region expanding). There are several possible applications of this revised semantics; in the second half of the paper we explore one of these in some depth – the problem of abstracting mereotopological relations from noisy video data, such that the sequences of qualitative relations between pairs of objects do not suffer from “jitter”. We show how a Hidden Markov Model can exploit this distance based semantics to yield improved interpretation of video data at a qualitative level.","Hide Markov Model, Spatial Relationship, Video Data, Boolean Combination, Test Segment"
2011,Decentralized Reasoning about Gradual Changes of Topological Relationships between Continuously Evolving Regions,"A key challenge facing many applications of new geosensor networks technology is to derive meaningful spatial knowledge from low-level sensed data. This paper presents a formal model for representing and computing topological relationship changes between continuously evolving regions monitored by a geosensor network. The definition of “continuity” is used to constrain region evolution and enables the local detection of node state transitions in the network. The model provides a computational framework for the detection of global high-level qualitative relationship changes from local low-level quantitative sensor measurements. In this paper, an efficient decentralized algorithm is also designed and implemented to detect relationship changes and its computational efficiency is evaluated experimentally using simulation.","Sensor Node, Wireless Sensor Network, Node State, Gradual Change, Spatial Region"
2011,Spatio-temporal Evolution as Bigraph Dynamics,We present a novel approach to modelling the evolution of spatial entities over time by using bigraphs. We use the links in a bigraph to represent the sharing of a common ancestor and the places in a bigraph to represent spatial nesting as usual. We provide bigraphical reaction rules that are able to model situations such as two crowds of people merging together while still keeping track of the resulting crowd’s historical links.,"spatio-temporal change, bigraphs, filiation"
2011,On Optimal Arrangements of Binary Sensors,"A large range of monitoring applications can benefit from binary sensor networks. Binary sensors can detect the presence or absence of a particular target in their sensing regions. They can be used to partition a monitored area and provide localization functionality. If many of these sensors are deployed to monitor an area, the area is partitioned into sub-regions: each sub-region is characterized by the sensors detecting targets within it. We aim to maximize the number of unique, distinguishable sub-regions. Our goal is an optimal placement of both omni-directional and directional static binary sensors. We compute an upper bound on the number of unique sub-regions, which grows quadratically with respect to the number of sensors. In particular, we propose arrangements of sensors within a monitored area whose number of unique sub-regions is asymptotically equivalent to the upper bound.","Optimal Arrangement, Sensor Arrangement, Directional Sensor, Monitor Area, Binary Sensor"
2011,A Hybrid Geometric-Qualitative Spatial Reasoning System and Its Application in GIS,We propose a hybrid geometric-qualitative spatial reasoning system that is able to simultaneously deal with input information that is partially given geometrically and partially qualitatively using spatial relations of different qualitative spatial calculi. The reasoning system combines a geometric reasoning component based on computational geometry methods with a qualitative reasoning component employing relation algebraic reasoning techniques. An egg-yolk representation approach is used to maintain information about objects with underdetermined geometry and also allows for vague objects in the input. In an experimental evaluation we apply the reasoning system to infer geometric information for a set of only qualitatively described objects. The experiments demonstrate that the hybrid reasoning approach produces better results than geometric and qualitative reasoning individually.,"Reference Object, Reasoning System, Simple Polygon, Constraint Network, Volunteer Geographic Information"
2011,CLP(QS): A Declarative Spatial Reasoning Framework,"We propose CLP(QS), a declarative spatial reasoning framework capable of representing and reasoning about high-level, qualitative spatial knowledge about the world. We systematically formalize and implement the semantics of a range of qualitative spatial calculi using a system of non-linear polynomial equations in the context of a classical constraint logic programming framework. Whereas CLP(QS) is a general framework, we demonstrate its applicability for the domain of Computer Aided Architecture Design. With CLP(QS) serving as a prototype, we position declarative spatial reasoning as a general paradigm open to other formalizations, reinterpretations, and extensions. We argue that the accessibility of qualitative spatial representation and reasoning mechanisms via the medium of high-level, logic-based formalizations is crucial for their utility toward solving real-world problems.","geometric and qualitative spatial reasoning, constraint logic programming, declarative programming, spatial computing, architecture design"
2011,The Social Connection in Mental Representations of Space: Explicit and Implicit Evidence,"To understand memory of and reasoning about real-world environments, all aspects of the environment, both spatial and non-spatial need to be considered. Non-spatial information can be either integral to or associated with the spatial information. This paper reviews two lines of research conducted in our lab that explore interactions between spatial information and non-spatial information associated with it (namely social information). Based on results of numerous studies, we propose that full accounts of spatial cognition about real-world environments should consider non-spatial influences, noting that some phenomena, while seemingly spatial in nature, may have substantive non-spatial influences.","spatial categorization, non-spatial categorization, implicit processing, social cognition"
2011,Revisiting the Plasticity of Human Spatial Cognition,"In a recent study by Haun et al. (2011), Dutch-speaking children who prefer an egocentric (left/right) reference frame when describing spatial relationships, and Hai||om-speaking children who use a geocentric (north/south) frame were found to vary in their capacity to memorize small-scale arrays using their language-incongruent system. In two experiments, we reconcile these results with previous findings by Li et al. (2011) which showed that English (egocentric) and Tseltal Mayan (geocentric) speakers can flexibly use both systems. In Experiment 1, attempting to replicate Haun et al., we found that English- but not Tseltal-speaking children could use their language-incongruent system. In Experiment 2, we demonstrate that Tseltal children can use an egocentric system when instructed nonverbally without left/right language. We argue that Haun et al.’s results are due to the Hai||om children’s lack of understanding of left/right instructions and that task constraints determine which system is easier to use.","linguistic relativity, frames of reference, Tseltal Mayan"
2011,Linguistic and Cultural Universality of the Concept of Sense-of-Direction,"We analyze self-reported sense-of-direction in samples of people from Santa Barbara, Freiburg, Saarbrücken, Tokyo, and Beijing. The Santa Barbara Sense-of-Direction Scale (SBSOD) by Hegarty and colleagues primarily assesses survey spatial abilities in directly-experienced environments. It was translated into German, Japanese, and Mandarin Chinese. Results suggest sense-of-direction is a unitary and meaningful concept across the five samples and four languages. In four of the samples, males report significantly better sense-of-direction than do females. Some variations are found across the five samples in overall level of sense-of-direction and in response patterns across the 15 items. Because it is strongly related to the survey spatial thinking that primarily underlies sense-of-direction, and because it can be counted in a relatively straightforward manner, we specifically examine thinking in terms of cardinal directions as a component of sense-of-direction, including conducting a count of cardinal-direction words from Internet corpora in the four languages. We find support for sense-of-direction as a coherent concept across the four languages and as a useful tool to measure individual differences in sense-of-direction. We also consider linguistic/cultural variations in sense-of-direction, especially with respect to variations in physical environments.","Sense-of-direction, cross-linguistic, individual differences, spatial corpora"

We show how permissions for actions of agents in social spaces can be modeled using the situations calculus.

2011,Finite Relativist Geometry Grounded in Perceptual Operations,"Formal geometry is a fundamental tool for showing how relevant metric qualities, such as depths, lengths, and volumes, as well as location concepts, such as points, can be constructed from experience. The ontological challenge of information grounding lies in the choice of concepts to consider as primitive, vs. those to be constructed. It also lies in accounting for the relativity and finiteness of experiential space. The grounding approach proposed here constructs geometrical concepts from primitives of the human attentional apparatus for guiding attention and performing perceptual operations. This apparatus enables humans to take attentional steps in their perceived vista environment and to perform geometric comparisons. We account for the relativity of experienced space by constructing locations relative to a reference frame of perceived point-like features. The paper discusses perceptual operations and the idea of point-like features, and introduces a constructive calculus that reflects the generation of domains of geometric comparison from the perspective of an observer. The calculus is then used to construct a model and to motivate an axiomatization of absolute geometry in a finite relativist flavour.","constructive Euclidean geometry, relativist geometry, information grounding, operational semantics"

This paper presents first empirical results regarding the type of utterances suitable for assisting the acquisition of survey knowledge on the basis of virtual tactile maps. The structure of the internal knowledge base, which has to support a connection between dynamic exploration movements and natural language, is presented. An example illustrates the approach and shows its practicability.","Virtual audio-tactile map, haptic human-computer interaction, representation for natural-language generation, assisted map reading, spatial knowledge acquisition"
2011,Analyzing the Spatial-Semantic Interaction of Points of Interest in Volunteered Geographic Information,"With the increasing success and commercial integration of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), the focus shifts away from coverage to data quality and homogeneity. Within the last years, several studies have been published analyzing the positional accuracy of features, completeness of specific attributes, or the topological consistency of line and polygon features. However, most of these studies do not take geographic feature types into account. This is for two reasons. First, and in contrast to street networks, choosing a reference set is difficult. Second, we lack the measures to quantify the degree of feature type mis-categorization. In this work, we present a methodology to analyze the spatial-semantic interaction of point features in Volunteered Geographic Information. Feature types in VGI can be considered special in both, the way they are formed and the way they are applied. Given that they reflect community agreement more accurately than top-down approaches, we argue that they should be used as the primary basis for assessing spatial-semantic interaction. We present a case study on a spatial and semantic subset of OpenStreetMap, and introduce a novel semantic similarity measure based on the change history of OpenStreetMap elements. Our results set the stage for systems that assist VGI contributors in suggesting the types of new features, cleaning up existing data, and integrating data from different sources.","Point Process, Semantic Similarity, Semantic Distance, Volunteer Geographic Information, Point Pattern Analysis"
2011,A Model of Spatial Reference Frames in Language,"We provide a systematic model of spatial reference frames. The model captures concepts underlying natural language expressions in English that represent both external and internal as well as static and dynamic relationships between entities. Our implementation in the functional language Haskell generates valid English sentences from situations and reference frames. Spatial reference frames are represented by the spatial roles of locatum, relatum, and, optionally, vantage, together with a directional system. Locatum, relatum, and vantage can be filled by entities taking on the discourse roles of speaker, addressee, andparticipant (grammatically expressed by first, second, and third person). Each of these roles may remain unspecified in a linguistic description.","reference frames, spatial relations, motion, conceptual modeling, natural language"
2011,"Universality, Language-Variability and Individuality: Defining Linguistic Building Blocks for Spatial Relations","Most approaches to the description of spatial relations for use in spatial querying attempt to describe a set of spatial relations that are universally understood by users. While this method has proved successful for expert users of geographic information, it is less useful for non-experts. Furthermore, while some work has implied the universal nature of spatial relations, a large amount of linguistic evidence shows that many spatial relations vary fundamentally across languages. Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) is a body of linguistic research that has identified the few specific spatial relations that are universal across languages. We show how these spatial relations can be used to describe a range of more complex spatial relations, including some from non-Indo-European languages that cannot readily be described with the usual spatial operators. Thus we propose that NSM is a tool that may be useful for the development of the next generation of spatial querying tools, supporting multilingual environments with widely differing ways of talking about space.","linguistics, spatial relations, multilingualism, Natural Semantic Metalanguage, spatial query"

The aim of this research is to apply a cognitive linguistics analysis for the semantics of a preposition in Farsi. The study takes Tyler and Evans’ [1] approach to polysemy as a means for developing the semantic network of Farsi preposition be with the central meaning similar to English to. For this purpose a large amount of corpus data were analyzed and the semantics of the preposition were studied. The results of the analysis showed that Tyler & Evanss’ Principled polysemy model can be successfully applied to the Farsi preposition be. The analysis sheds light on the semantics of this preposition and highlights the potential ability of this model for the systematic account of prepositions in languages other than English.","categorization, cognitive linguistics, meaning, polysemy preposition, prototype, spatial configuration"
2011,On the Explicit and Implicit Spatiotemporal Architecture of Narratives of Personal Experience,"Expanding on recent research into the predictability of explicit linguistic spatial information relative to features of discourse structure, we present the results of several machine learning studies which leverage rhetorical relations, events, temporal information, text sequence, and both explicit and implicit linguistic spatial information in three different corpora of narrative discourses. On average, classifiers predict figure, ground, spatial verb and preposition and frame of reference to 75% accuracy, rhetorical relations to 72% accuracy, and events to 76% accuracy (all values have statistical significance above majority class baselines). These results hold independent of the number of authors, subject matter, length and density of spatial and temporal information. Consequently, we argue for a generalized model of spatiotemporal information in narrative discourse, which not only provides a deeper understanding of the semantics and pragmatics of discourse structure, but also alternative robust approaches to analysis.","Spatial Information, Majority Class, Temporal Information, Discourse Structure, Elaboration Relation"
2022,What Do You Mean You’re in Trafalgar Square? Comparing Distance Thresholds for Geospatial Prepositions,"Natural language location descriptions frequently describe object locations relative to other objects (the house near the river). Geospatial prepositions (e.g.near) are a key element of these descriptions, and the distances associated with proximity, adjacency and topological prepositions are thought to depend on the context of a specifc scene. When referring to the context, we include consideration of properties of the relatum such as its feature type, size and associated image schema. In this paper, we extract spatial descriptions from the Google search engine for nine prepositions across three locations, compare their acceptance thresholds (the distances at which diferent prepositions are acceptable), and study variations in diferent contexts using cumulative graphs and scatter plots. Our results show that adjacency prepositions next to and adjacent to are used for a large range of distances, in contrast to beside; and that topological prepositions in, at and on can all be used to indicate proximity as well as containment and collocation. We also found that reference object image schema infuences the selection of geospatial prepositions such as near and in.","contextual factors, spatial descriptions, acceptance model, spatial template, applicability model, geospatial prepositions"
2022,I Can Tell by Your Eyes! Continuous Gaze-Based Turn-Activity Prediction Reveals Spatial Familiarity,"Spatial familiarity plays an essential role in the wayfnding decision-making process. Recent fndings in wayfnding activity recognition domain suggest that wayfnders’ turning behavior at junctions is strongly infuenced by their spatial familiarity. By continuously monitoring wayfnders’ turning behavior as refected in their eye movements during the decision-making period (i.e., immediately after an instruction is received until reaching the corresponding junction for which the instruction was given), we provide evidence that familiar and unfamiliar wayfnders can be distinguished. By applying a pre-trained XGBoost turning activity classifer on gaze data collected in a real-world wayfnding task with 33 participants, our results suggest that familiar and unfamiliar wayfnders show diferent onset and intensity of turning behavior. These variations are not only present between the two classes –familiar vs. unfamiliar– but also within each class. The diferences in turning-behavior within each class may stem from multiple sources, including diferent levels of familiarity with the environment.","Spatial Familiarity, Gaze-based Activity Recognition, Wayfnding, Machine, Learning"
2022,Automatically Discovering Conceptual Neighborhoods Using Machine Learning Methods,"Qualitative spatio-temporal reasoning (QSTR) plays a key role in spatial cognition and artifcial intelligence (AI) research. In the past, research and applications of QSTR have often taken place in the context of declarative forms of knowledge representation. For instance, conceptual neighborhoods (CN) and composition tables (CT) of relations are introduced explicitly and utilized for spatial/temporal reasoning. Orthogonal to this line of study, we focus on bottom-up machine learning (ML) approaches to investigate QSTR. More specifcally, we are interested in questions of whether similarities between qualitative relations can be learned from data purely based on ML models, and, if so, how these models difer from the ones studied by traditional approaches. To achieve this, we propose a graph-based approach to examine the similarity of relations by analyzing trained ML models. Using various experiments on synthetic data, we demonstrate that the relationships discovered by ML models are well-aligned with CN structures introduced in the (theoretical) literature, for both spatial and temporal reasoning. Noticeably, even with signifcantly limited qualitative information for training, ML models are still able to automatically construct neighborhood structures. Moreover, patterns of asymmetric similarities between relations are disclosed using such a data-driven approach. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the frst to automatically discover CNs without any domain knowledge. Our results can be applied to discovering CNs of any set of jointly exhaustive and pairwise disjoint (JEPD) relations.","Qualitative Spatial Reasoning, Qualitative Temporal Reasoning, Conceptual Neighborhood, Machine Learning, Knowledge Discovery"
2022,Predicting Distance and Direction from Text Locality Descriptions for Biological Specimen Collections,"A considerable proportion of records that describe biological specimens (fora, soil, invertebrates), and especially those that were collected decades ago, are not attached to corresponding geographical coordinates, but rather have their location described only through textual descriptions (e.g. North Canterbury, Selwyn River near bridge on Springston-Leeston Rd). Without geographical coordinates, millions of records stored in museum collections around the world cannot be mapped. We present a method for predicting the distance and direction associated with human language location descriptions which focuses on the interpretation of geospatial prepositions and the way in which they modify the location represented by an associated reference place name (e.g. near the Manawatu River). We study eight distance-oriented prepositions and eight direction-oriented prepositions and use machine learning regression to predict distance or direction, relative to the reference place name, from a collection of training data. The results show that, compared with a simple baseline, our model improved distance predictions by up to 60% and direction predictions by up to 31%.","geospatial prepositions, biological specimen collections, georeferencing, natural language processing, locative expressions, locality descriptions, geoparsing, geocoding, geographic information retrieval, regression, machine learning"
2022,An Incremental Algorithm for Handling Qualitative Spatio-Temporal Information,"In this paper, we present an online (incremental) algorithm for checking the satisfability of qualitative spatio-temporal data, with direct implications to other fundamental knowledge representation and reasoning problems for such data, like the problems of deductive closure and redundancy removal. In particular, qualitative data come in the form of human-like, symbolic, descriptions such as “region x contains or overlaps region y”, which are abundant in the Web of Data. Our approach is also able to maintain, to some extent, any sparse graph structure that may be inherent in the data, i.e., it acts parsimoniously and only tries to infer new information when needed for soundness and completeness. To this end, we complement our practical algorithm with certain theoretical results to assert its correctness and efciency. A subsequent evaluation with publicly available large-scale real-world and random datasets against the state of the art, shows the interest and promise of our method.","Online algorithm, qualitative data, spatio-temporal reasoning, satisfability checking, knowledge representation and reasoning"
2022,Rethinking Route Choices! On the Importance of Route Selection in Wayfnding Experiments,"Route selection for a wayfnding experiment is not a trivial task and is often made in an undocumented way. Only recently (2021), a systematic, reproducible and score-based approach for route selection for wayfnding experiments was published. However, it is still unclear how robust study results are across all potential routes in a particular experimental area. An important share of routes might lead to diferent conclusions than most routes. This share would distort and/or invert the study outcome. If so, the question of selecting routes that are unlikely to distort the results of our wayfnding experiments remains unanswered. In order to answer these questions, an agent-based simulation study with four diferent sample sizes (N = 15, 25, 50, 3000 agents) comparing Turn-by-Turn and Free Choice Navigation approaches (between-subject design) regarding their arrival rates on more than 11000 routes in the city center of Vienna, Austria, was run. The results of our study indicate that with decreasing sample size, there is an increase in the share of routes which lead to contradictory results regarding the arrival rate, i.e., the results become less robust. Therefore, based on simulation results, we present an approach for selecting suitable routes even for small-scale in-situ studies.","Route Selection, Route Features, Human Wayfnding, Navigation, Experiments, Experimental Design"
2022,Empirical Evidence for Concepts of Spatial Information as Cognitive Means for Interpreting and Using Maps,"Due to the increasing prevalence and relevance of geo-spatial data in the age of data science, Geographic Information Systems are enjoying wider interdisciplinary adoption by communities outside of GIScience. However, properly interpreting and analysing geo-spatial information is not a trivial task due to knowledge barriers. There is a need for a trans-disciplinary framework for sharing specialized geographical knowledge and expertise to overcome these barriers. The core concepts of spatial information were proposed as such a conceptual framework. These concepts, such as object and feld, were proposed as cognitive lenses that can simplify understanding of and guide the processing of spatial information. However, there is a distinct lack of empirical evidence for the existence of such concepts in the human mind or whether such concepts can be indeed useful. In this study, we have explored for such empirical evidence using behavioral experiments with human participants. The experiment adopted a contrast model to investigate whether the participants can semantically distinguish between the object and feld core concepts visualized as maps. The statistically signifcant positive results ofer evidence supporting the existence of the two concepts or cognitive concepts closely resembling them. This gives credibility to the core concepts of spatial information as tools for sharing, teaching, or even automating the process of geographical information processing.","core concepts, cognition, map interpretation, spatial analysis"
2022,"Generalized, Inaccurate, Incomplete: How to Comprehensively Analyze Sketch Maps Beyond Their Metric Correctness","Sketch mapping is a method to investigate a person’s spatial perception and knowledge about the surrounding environment. While cartographic maps can be easily evaluated with respect to the represented features, map scale, and spatial accuracy, there still does not exist a comprehensive method to evaluate sketch maps. This paper aims to overcome this gap and proposes a sketch map analysis method that allows for analyzing the completeness, generalization and (qualitative) spatial accuracy of the sketched information in a three-step process. After describing the method, we illustrate how our computer-supported method performs in a use case with three sketch maps. Our approach may assist researchers in geography, psychology, and education to evaluate spatial knowledge in a systematic way independent of specifc research questions and experimental scenarios.","sketch map analysis, spatial knowledge evaluation, cognitive map"
2022,Perceptions of Qualitative Spatial Arrangements of Three Objects,"Cognitive grounding of formal models of qualitative spatial relations is important to bridge between spatial data and human perceptions of spatial arrangements. Here, we report on an experimental verifcation of the cognitive alignment of the recently proposed Ray Intersection Model (RIM) capturing qualitative relationships between three spatial objects, and human perceptions of spatial arrangements through a grouping task. Further, we explore arrangements with an object positioned “between” two other objects. We show that RIM has sufcient expressive power and aligns well with human perceptions of ternary spatial relationships.","Spatial Perception, Qualitative Spatial Relationships, Betweenness, Evaluation, Ternary Relationships"
2022,Are Psychological Variables Relevant to Evaluating Geoinformatics Applications? The Case of Landmarks (Vision Paper),"Interdisciplinary integration of spatial cognition and spatial computation promises to create better spatial technology based on fndings from cognitive psychology experiments. Using the example of psychological studies and computational modelling of landmarks, this paper argues that core evaluation criteria of both disciplines are not well aligned with the goal of evaluating landmarkenhanced navigation support systems that support users in everyday wayfnding. The paper raises two points. First, it reviews evaluation criteria used in the interdisciplinary feld of landmark research. It is argued that when to consider the role of landmark-enhanced navigation support systems in everyday life of their users, diferent evaluation criteria are needed. If strictly-psychological or strictly-computational criteria continue being prioritised by the community, we risk undervaluing signifcant technological contributions. Second, it proposes one such potential criterion: testing whether the cognitive task has changed due to equipping users with the new technology. This goal might be achieved at the expense of criteria typical to strictly-psychological studies (such as spatial memory of landmarks along the travelled route) or strictly-computational studies (such as efciency and accuracy of a landmark-selection algorithm). Thus, promoting and implementing alternative evaluation criteria comes with methodological risks. In order to mitigate them we propose a process based on pre-registration of “postdiction” studies and hope to stimulate a further debate on a consensus-based approach in the community.","wayfnding, navigation support systems, cognitive geoengineering, landmarks"
2022,New Human Dynamics in the Emerging Metaverse: Towards a Quantum Phygital Approach by Integrating Space and Place,"With the convergence of mirror worlds, virtual worlds, lifelogging, and augmented/virtual reality, the emerging metaverse is rapidly becoming a major platform where humans work, shop, entertain themselves, and socialize with others. Human dynamics, which refers to all forms of human activities and interactions, will undergo profound transformations in the coming years with the advent of the metaverse. The new human dynamics will be neither physical nor digital but a seamless integration of both – phygital2 . The goal of this vision paper is to develop a phygital approach to support human dynamics research in the spirit of GIScience as a convergence. Built on our earlier work in human dynamics research, we argue that the current discussions on human dynamics are conceptually constrained by their physical and digital silos. The new phygital approach we are envisioning aims to transcend the simplistic dichotomy by integrating both space and place perspectives. This paper also draws on basic concepts in quantum physics and earlier discussions on their potential applications in geography and GIScience to espouse a quantum turn in exploring the human dynamics in the emerging metaverse. It explores how concepts, methods, and understandings from quantum physics and emerging quantum computing and communication technologies can be translated into addressing fundamental geographical analyses for this phygital world.","metaverse, human dynamics, phygital, space-place, quantum, GIScience theory"
2022,Large-Scale Spatial Prediction by Scalable Geographically Weighted Regression: Comparative Study,"Although the scalable geographically weighted regression (GWR) has been developed as a fast regression approach modeling non-stationarity, its potential on spatial prediction is largely unexplored. Given that, this study applies the scalable GWR technique for large-scale spatial prediction, and compares its prediction accuracy with modern geostatistical methods including the nearest-neighbor Gaussian process, and machine learning algorithms including light gradient boosting machine. The result suggests accuracy of our scalable GWR-based prediction.","Spatial prediction, Scalable geographically weighted regression, Large data, Housing price"
2022,Geographically Varying Coefcient Regression: GWR-Exit and GAM-On?,This paper describes initial work exploring two spatially varying coefcient models: multi-scale GWR and GAM Gaussian Process spline parameterised by observation location. Both approaches accommodate process spatial heterogeneity and both generate outputs that can be mapped indicating the nature of the process heterogeneity. However the nature of the process heterogeneity they each describe are very diferent. This suggests that the underlying semantics of such models need to be considered in order to refne the specifcity of the questions that are asked of data: simply seeking to understand process spatial heterogeneity may be too semantically coarse.,"Geographically weighted regression, Spatial Analysis, Process Spatial Heterogeneity, Model Semantics"
2022,"3D Sketch Maps: Concept, Potential Benefts, and Challenges","Studying the 3D aspect of spatial information has become increasingly important due to changes in the way we interact with the surrounding environments as well as technological innovations. Current pen-and-paper approaches of sketch mapping have a limitation in investigating 3D spatial knowledge as they are forced to be drawn on 2D interfaces. In this paper, we propose the concept of 3D sketch mapping as a tool to study human spatial knowledge by externalizing the mental models of spatial information with 3D representations. The goal of this paper is to introduce the concept, discuss its potential importance and challenges, and share our vision for future research directions.","Sketch maps, mental representations, spatial knowledge"
2022,The Efect of Abstract vs. Realistic 3D Visualization on Landmark and Route Knowledge Acquisition,"Even though humans perform it daily, navigation is a cognitively challenging process. Landmarks have been shown to facilitate navigation by scafolding humans’ mental representation of space. However, how landmarks can be efectively communicated to pedestrians to support spatial learning of the traversed environment remains an open question. Therefore, we assessed how the visualization of landmarks on a mobile map (i.e., abstract 3D vs. realistic 3D symbols) infuences participants’ spatial learning, visual attention allocation, and cognitive load during an outdoor map-assisted navigation task. We report initial results on how exposing pedestrians to diferent landmark visualization styles on mobile maps while navigating along a given route in an urban environment can have difering efects on how they remember landmarks and routes. Specifcally, we fnd that navigators better remember landmarks visualized as 3D realistic-looking symbols compared to 3D abstract landmark symbols on the mobile map. The pattern of results shows that displaying realistic 3D landmark symbols at intersections potentially helps participants to remember route directions better than with landmarks depicted as abstract 3D symbols. The presented methodological approach contributes ecologically valid insights to further understand how the design of landmarks on mobile maps could support wayfnders’ spatial learning during map-assisted navigation.","Abstraction, realism, 3D, landmark visualization, mobile map design, cartography, real-world navigation, spatial learning"
2022,"Smart Crowd Management: The Data, the Users and the Solution","This research project is situated in the domain of smart crowd management, a domain that is gaining importance because of the challenges that arise from urbanization, but also the opportunities that come with smart cities. While our cities become more crowded every day, they also become smarter, for example by employing pedestrian tracking sensors. However, the datasets that are generated by these sensors do not allow smart crowd management yet, because they are sparse and not linked to the perception of the crowd. This research will tackle these issues in three steps. First, pedestrian counts will be estimated on streets that have no tracking data by use of deep learning and space syntax data. Next, the perception of crowdedness within the crowd will be linked to the objective pedestrian counts by conducting two user studies, and fnally, the resulting subjective pedestrian counts will be used as weights for a routing algorithm. The last step has already been developed as a proof of concept. The routing algorithm, that uses partly simulated data and partly real-time tracking data, has been embedded in a webtool to show stakeholders the potential and goal of this innovative project.","crowd tracking, crowd modeling, space syntax, deep learning, perception, routing"
2022,A Weather-Aware Framework for Population Mobility Modelling,"The widespread availability of GPS-enabled mobile devices has contributed towards an unprecedented volume of data on human movement. Human mobility data are the key input for developing accurate mobility models that can support decision-making in, for example, urban planning, transportation planning and disease spread. However, the increasing geoprivacy concerns have been limiting the use of and access to such data. For this reason, the WHO-WHERE-WHEN (3W) model, a privacy-protective model for generating synthetic mobility data, has been developed. However, human mobility is afected by multiple factors that must be accounted for to produce synthetic mobility trajectories that accurately simulate the fuctuations of population in a study area. The 3W model already considers four main factors afecting human mobility: size and shape of activity spaces, circadian rhythm, and home and work locations. Yet, meteorological factors are known to afect human mobility patterns but, to our knowledge, there is not a model that accounts for weather conditions. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework to extend the 3W model to a 4W model: WHO-WHERE-WHEN-WEATHER. We hypothesise that accounting for weather conditions in human mobility predictions will increase the overall accuracy of predicted mobility patterns.","movement analytics, human movement, mobility models, context-awareness"
2022,Qualitative Spatial Reasoning over Questions,"Although geospatial question answering systems have received increasing attention in recent years, existing prototype systems struggle to properly answer qualitative spatial questions. In this work, we propose a unique framework for answering qualitative spatial questions, which comprises three main components: a geoparser that takes the input questions and extracts place semantic information from text, a reasoning system which is embedded with a crisp reasoner, and fnally, answer extraction, which refnes the solution space and generates fnal answers. We present an experimental design to evaluate our framework for point-based cardinal direction calculus (CDC) relations by developing an automated approach for generating three types of synthetic qualitative spatial questions. The initial evaluations of generated answers in our system are promising because a high proportion of answers were labelled correct.","Qualitative spatial reasoning, geospatial question answering, Qualitative spatial questions"
2022,Transcepts: Connecting Entity Representations Across Conceptual Views on Spatial Information,"Analysts interpret geographic and other spatial data to check the validity of methods in reaching an analytical goal. However, the meaning of data is elusive. The same data may constitute one concept in one view and another concept in another. For example, the same set of air pollution points may be regarded as feld values if they are considered pollution measurements and objects if they are considered locations of measurement devices. In this work we adopt a framework of conceptual spaces and viewpoints and show how entity representations in one semantic interpretation may be related to entity representations in others in terms of what we call transcepts. A transcept captures which things represent the same entity. We defne and use transcepts in the framework to explain how diferent views of geographic data may relate to one another.","Transcept, Spatial Information, Knowledge Representation, Conceptual Space, View, Point Of View, Viewpoint, Object, Event, Network, Field, Relation"
2022,A Computational Method for the Classifcation of Mental Representations of Objects in 3D Space,"The structure mapping task is a simple method to test people’s mental representations of spatial relationships, and has recently been particularly useful in the study of volumetric spatial cognition such as the spatial memory for locations in multilevel buildings. However, there does not exist a standardised method to analyse such data and structure mapping tasks are typically analysed by human raters, based on criteria defned by the researchers. In this article, we introduce a computational method to assess spatial relationships of objects in the vertical and horizontal domains, which are realized through the structure mapping task. Here, we reanalyse participants’ digitised structure maps from an earlier study (N=41) using the proposed computational methodology. Our results show that the new method successfully distinguishes between diferent types of structure map representations, and is sensitive to learning order efects. This method can be useful to advance the study of volumetric spatial cognition.","mental representations of space, spatial cognition, structure mapping task, 3D space, volumetric space"
2022,A Comparison of Geographically Weighted Principal Components Analysis Methodologies,"Principal components analysis (PCA) is a useful analytical tool to represent key characteristics of multivariate data, but does not account for spatial efects when applied in geographical situations. A geographically weighted PCA (GWPCA) caters to this issue, specifcally in terms of capturing spatial heterogeneity. However, in certain situations, a GWPCA provides outputs that vary discontinuously spatially, which are difcult to interpret and are not associated with the output from a conventional (global) PCA any more. This study underlines a GW non-negative PCA, a geographically weighted version of non-negative PCA, to overcome this issue by constraining loading values non-negatively. Case study results with a complex multivariate spatial dataset demonstrate such benefts, where GW non-negative PCA allows improved interpretations than that found with conventional GWPCA.","Spatial heterogeneity, Geographically weighted, Sparsity, PCA"
2022,Abnormal Situation Simulation and Dynamic Causality Discovery in Urban Trafc Networks,"Various participants in urban trafc systems intertwine a highly complicated coupling network. An interpretable analysis of underlying correlations is one of the keys to understanding trafc anomalies. Unfortunately, abnormal situation analysis in real scenarios faces severe limitations in negative sample defciency, data integrity, and verifability. In view of this, we developed a simulation tool – the Trafc Anomaly Situation Simulator (TASS). Through confgurable scripts, TASS simulates real trafc networks by road editing, data collection, and fault injection. Given the generated cases, we designed a dynamic causal discovery algorithm, Dycause-Trafc, to demonstrate the features of causality in trafc anomalies.","SUMO simulation, dynamic causality discovery, congestion propagation"
2022,Spatial and Spatiotemporal Matching Framework for Causal Inference,"Matching is a procedure aimed at reducing the impact of observational data bias in causal analysis. Designing matching methods for spatial data refecting static spatial or dynamic spatio-temporal processes is complex because of the efects of spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity. Both may be compounded with temporal lag in the dependency efects on the study units. Current matching techniques based on similarity indexes and pairing strategies need to be extended with optimal spatial matching procedures. Here, we propose a decision framework to support analysts through the choice of existing matching methods and anticipate the development of specialized matching methods for spatial data. This framework thus enables to identify knowledge gaps.","Framework, Spatial, Spatiotemporal, Matching, Causal Inference"
2022,An Entropy-Based Model for Indoor Self-Localization Through Dialogue,"People can be localized at a particular location in an indoor environment using verbal descriptions referring to distinct visible objects (e.g., landmarks). When a user provides an incomplete initial location description their location may remain ambiguous. Here, we consider a dialogue initiated to update the initial description, which continues until the updated description can be related to a location in the environment. In each interaction, the wayfnder is incrementally asked about the visibility of a particular object to update the initial description. This paper presents an entropy-based model to minimize the number of interactions. We show how this entropy-based model leads to a signifcant reduction of interactions (i.e., reduction of conversation length, measured by the number of additional referents) compared to baseline models. Moreover, the efect of the initial description, i.e., the frst set of visible objects with diferent combinations, is investigated.","Indoor self-localization, Dialogue, Entropy"
2022,Collaborative Wayfnding Under Distributed Spatial Knowledge,"In many everyday situations, two or more people navigate collaboratively but their spatial knowledge does not necessarily overlap. However, most research to date, has investigated social wayfnding under either 1-sided or fully shared spatial information. Here, we present the pilot experiment of a novel, computerised, non-verbal experimental paradigm to study collaborative wayfnding under the face of spatial information uncertainty. Participants (N=32) learned two diferent neighbourhoods individually, and then navigated together as dyads (D=16), from one neighbourhood to the other. Our pilot results reveal that overall participants share navigational control, but are in control more when the task leads them to a familiar destination. We discuss the efects of spatial ability and motivation to lead, as well as the outlook of the paradigm.","navigation, wayfnding, collaboration, dyad, online"
2022,Abnormal Trajectory-Gap Detection: A Summary,"Given trajectories with gaps (i.e., missing data), we investigate algorithms to identify abnormal gaps for testing possible hypotheses of anomalous regions. Here, an abnormal gap within a trajectory is defned as an area where a given moving object did not report its location, but other moving objects did periodically. The problem is important due to its societal applications, such as improving maritime safety and regulatory enforcement for global security concerns such as illegal fshing, illegal oil transfer, and trans-shipments. The problem is challenging due to the difculty of interpreting missing data within a trajectory gap, and the high computational cost of detecting gaps in such a large volume of location data proves computationally very expensive. The current literature assumes linear interpolation within gaps, which may not be able to detect abnormal gaps since objects within a given region may have traveled away from their shortest path. To overcome this limitation, we propose an abnormal gap detection (AGD) algorithm that leverages the concepts of a space-time prism model where we assume space-time interpolation. We then propose a refned memoized abnormal gap detection (Memo-AGD) algorithm that reduces comparison operations. We validated both algorithms using synthetic and real-world data. The results show that abnormal gaps detected by our algorithms give better estimates of abnormality than linear interpolation and can be used for further investigation from the human analysts.","Spatial Data Mining, Trajectory Mining, Time Geography"
2022,Improving Pedestrians Trafc Priority via Grouping and Virtual Lanes in Shared Spaces,"The shared space design is applied in urban streets to support barrier-free movement and integrate trafc participants (such as pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles) into a common road space. Regardless of the low-speed environment, sharing space with motor vehicles can make vulnerable road users feel uneasy. Yet, walking in groups increases their confdence as well as infuence the yielding behavior of drivers. Therefore, we propose an innovative approach to support the crossing of pedestrians via grouping and project the virtual lanes in shared spaces. This paper presents the important components of the crowd steering system, discusses the enablers and gaps in the current approach, and illustrates the proposed idea with concept diagrams.","shared space, urban traffic system, augmented reality, pedestrian grouping"
2022,Eye Blink-Related Brain Potentials During Landmark-Based Navigation in Virtual Reality,"Landmarks support navigation and spatial learning of environments by serving as cognitive anchors. However, little research has been done to investigate how the design of landmarks on mobile maps afects cognitive processing. To address this gap, the present study utilized a within-subjects design to experimentally examine how three diferent landmark densities (3 vs. 5 vs. 7 landmarks) on mobile maps infuence users’ spatial learning and cognitive load during navigation. Cognitive load was measured using electroencephalography (EEG). We applied an event-related analysis approach by utilizing eye blinks as naturalistic event markers to segment the EEG data. Results demonstrate that showing fve landmarks along a given route to follow on a mobile map, compared to three and seven landmarks, improved spatial learning performance without taxing more cognitive resources. Our study shows that users’ cognitive load and spatial learning outcomes should be considered when designing landmark-based navigation assistance systems.","spatial navigation, landmark, blink-related potentials, spatial learning, cognitive load, mobile map"
